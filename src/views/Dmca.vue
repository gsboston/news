        <p> - Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
            activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably

            complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
            infringed. </p>

            infringing content. </p>
        <p> 2. Counter-Notice Procedure: If you believe that the content that was removed or to which access has been
            disabled is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright
            owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such content, you may send a counter-notice

            at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled; </p>
        <p> - A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of
            mistake or a misidentification of the content; and </p>
        <p> - Your name, an address, telephone number, and email address and a statement that you consent to the
            jurisdiction of the federal court located in [insert district, or if outside of the U.S., then indicate
